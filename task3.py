Your Hero Story!

This is all about dictionaries. Note the method I didnâ€™t show in class was .items(). it returns the key values pairs in the dictionary back as a list of tuples. Try it out!

story1 = {
    "start": "Once upon a time, in a galaxy not that far away, in the greatest country in the World - United Kingdom...",
    "middle": "The guy tired of his life because he was already after 30 started a journey for a brighter future. Frustrated with previous missions and figting enemies in a land called Retail,\n"
              "he jumped in his ship and sailed to an ancient Greece - Sparta. He had to leave his friendly horse named Mac behind as in Sparta there was no place for such horses as Mac. \n"
              "Completely alone in a new land he set up the base and waited for new things to come.\n"
              "Right after that he was attacked by a giant snake named Python. Python had 3 heads that's why local people in Sparta called him Python3.\n"
              "Our gur knew he could not beat him on his own. He needed help and help arrived. It was a Mac? No, this horse just looked like Mac. It was black horse called Windows...",
    "end": "Together with Windows our guy beat the Python to death. What will happen next? Who knows but local people say something about another creature terrorizing the Sparta called Azure.",
}
